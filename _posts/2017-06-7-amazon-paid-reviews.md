I find it irritating that Amazon is either allowing or turning a blind eye towards the paid reviews. I also find it hard to believe that they don't implement a better algorithm for detecting fake reviews like that of Yelp. After discovering [FakeSpot](http://fakespot.com/) and looking up a few of my prior purchases, I felt betrayed. I've come to realize that 5-star reviews on Amazon products not only help the seller, but Amazon as well since people are more prone to spend money on their website. 

Be sure to use FakeSpot every time before purchasing an item on Amazon. Here is an email I got from one of the sellers I purchased from after leaving a negative review.
