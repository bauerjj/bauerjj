I find it irritating that Amazon is either allowing or turning a blind eye towards the paid reviews. I also find it hard to believe that they don't implement a better algorithm for detecting fake reviews like that of Yelp. After discovering [FakeSpot](http://fakespot.com/) and looking up a few of my prior purchases, I felt betrayed. I've come to realize that 5-star reviews on Amazon products not only help the seller, but Amazon as well since people are more prone to spend money on their website. 

I recently had a Microdermabrasion done and thought that I'd just get the machine to do it for me instead of at a spa. So I tried the [#1 recommended one](https://www.amazon.com/Microdermabrasion-Blackhead-Rechargeable-Comedone-Extractor). Long story short, it sucked (or not at all) and so I left a prompt review. Soon after, I started getting emails - 6 total thus far over the course of a month of the manufacturer trying to bribe me to take down the review.

Here is an email I got from one of the sellers I purchased from after leaving a negative review.

 But then they tried to sweeten the pot with a $200 gift card!

I reported every single email to Amazon customer support. 

> Hello,
>
> I'm sorry to hear about this, it sounds like the seller isn't following our rules. Our investigations team can look into this further and determine the best action to take.
>
> To help you, I've forwarded the details you sent us to our Investigations team. Each report they receive is investigated and the appropriate action is taken. However, we won't be able to release the outcome of the investigation.
>
> This will ensure you that the seller will stop sending you email offering gift card by removing your feedback to their products. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any further questions or concerns.
>
> We hope to see you again soon.
>
> We'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the buttons below to vote about your experience today.

> Best regards,

I then get more spam email where my only choice is to setup a filter to block the mention of the manufactures so that it is sent to spam. I don't want to filter based on the Amazon domain since I order stuff frequently. 

Be sure to use FakeSpot every time before purchasing an item on Amazon.
