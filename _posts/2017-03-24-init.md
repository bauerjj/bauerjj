This is my initial post on here. I don't quite know how to use this space other than to blog about tech related material and other things on my mind that come up throughout the day. It may turn into a sudo-journal (inner personal stuff omitted of course) that I can reflect upon later. I also want to use this space to publicly share things like investing and the places I visit around Phoenix, AZ. 

I want to allow people to comment as always, however I don't want to use disqus. I'm thinking of rehashing a PHP script that I bought on my other laravel site and using it to serve up the comments. Another project....
