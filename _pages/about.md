My name is Justin Bauer and I'm an electrical Engineer that works mostly on software coincidently. I've spent vast more numbers of hours on a keyboard compared to that with a soldering iron or electronics in general. This website is meant to catalog technology related ideas among other various topics that I think myself and other people may find useful. Most of the pages are "living documents" that I edit continuously on a day-to-day basis. I currently live in Tempe, Arizona.  

### Professional

I graduated Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2011 with a BS in Electrical Engineering. I've since worked at both big and small companies:

 * Microchip Technology - Applications Engineer in their 8-bit division (2011-2015)
 * Blockwise Engineering - Software/Electrical Engineer (2015-2017)
 * AgJunction - Embedded Software Engineer (2017-present)
  
I also do freelance work with various clients on mostly embedded or mobile software applications. Please contact me if you'd like for me to work on your idea.

Please see my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-bauer-a7a9ba116) for more information. 

### Hobbyist


In 2016 I created a microcontroller discussion website called [mcuhq](http://mcuhq.com) where I post projects pertaining to microntrollers and embedded linux systems. 

In 2017 I launched this blog initially as a means for me to easily keep track of places to go in Phoenix. I've since grown it to encompass some tech posts along with other useful notes that I can easily reference again. 

Please see the [projects page](https://bauerjj.github.io/projects/) for more information on past and current projects of mine as well as my [github](https://github.com/bauerjj).
