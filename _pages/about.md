My name is Justin Bauer and I'm an electrical Engineer that works mostly on software coincidently. I've spent vast more numbers of hours on a keyboard compared to that with a soldering iron or electronics in general. This website is meant to catalog technology related ideas and tips among other various topics that I think myself and other people may find useful. Most of the pages are "living documents" that I edit continuously such as places to visit in Phoenix, AZ.  

### The Beginnings
I graduated Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2011 with a BS in Electrical Engineering, but before that I started my journy into electronics by means of the modified xbox console scene. This was back in 2003 when xbox-scene.com, XBins, and [team-xecuter](team-xecuter.com) were  household names - well, sorta. I started a small side business modifying the consoles for people. Fast-forward to the present day and I still have 3 of my modified xbox consoles! 

### Big Company

I moved to Arizona from Chicago where I began working at Microchip Technology as an Applications Engineer in their 8-bit division. This is where I began programming in C and assembler almost every day. I worked on the popular PIC16/8 platforms (enhanced-midrange if you want to get all technical) and helped develop numerous reference designs for customers and Microchip - namely the [PICkit3 Starter Kit](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/41628B.pdf). I stayed here for ~4 years which included tech training, [teaching at conferences](www.microchip.com/masters), traveling to Europe, publishing App Notes ([Motor Control](www.microchip.com/mymicrochip/filehandler.aspx?ddocname=en567897) and [Peripheral Tools](www.microchip.com/wwwAppNotes/AppNotes.aspx?appnote=en560404)) and in general working on all sorts of different software and electrical projects. It was an awesome time and I only felt stressed out a few times a year. Free ice-cream breaks every Wednesday and Donuts on Friday were cool perks. Microchip was a cool place to start and they are for sure growing at a record pace as they keep acquiring companies and [hitting all time highs in their stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=mchp). 

### Big->Small Company

I then transitioned to a small company called [Blockwise Engineering](www.blockwise.com/). I wanted to experience the small company feel and have a bigger responsibility and I for sure accomplished both of those goals quickly. This is where I began down the rabbit hole that is embedded linux. I started learning Yocto and eventually got it working on an iMX6 BSP with a touchscreen running Qt. After much googling and experimentation, Blockwise began shipping out their new medical devices with a [much improved interface](https://youtu.be/0c1l87ZRFfQ?t=14s) that is easier to use, upgrade, and program. I also got back in touch with the electrical side of things by designing some PCBs, soldering SMD components, and playing with motors. The contrast between Microchip and Blockwise was vast in terms of the engineering pace and technology, but they were both mentally challenging and enjoyable to work at.    

### Hobbyist Stuff

In 2016 I created a microcontroller discussion website called [mcuhq](http://mcuhq.com). I had a different version created in [codeigniter](https://codeigniter.com) circa 2012, but I "feature creep'ed" this to death and eventually gave up after 1 year of development. I learned my mistakes and launched a much sleeker and slim version using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework. It took a few months of development to get the website coded and there have been minimal updates since the launch. It is constructed to allow anyone to post their tutorials or hacks as long as they are in-depth and reproducible. I was sick of the "hack-a-day" sites like instructables that didn't give enough information to complete the project. 

In 2017 I launched this blog initially as a means for me to easily keep track of places to go in Phoenix. I kept using my phone to jot down notes, whether it be of music, restaurants, quotes, articles, documentaries, etc. By using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I can open up a text document and update it live within a few minutes on github. 

I also [began freelacing](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~0143336a2b30982239/) in 2016 as a means to get exposed to different microcontrollers and projects. 

This turned out to be much longer than I anticipated...
