## Social 

 - [Water and Power:  the California heist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6290202/)  Water == $$$
 - [Merchants of Doubt](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3675568/) - Public health research 
 - [Betting on Zero](https://www.netflix.com/title/80108609) - How Herbalife is a scam

## Diet

 - [Sour Grapes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5728684/) - counterfeit wine is apparently easy to fool even the best connoisseur.
