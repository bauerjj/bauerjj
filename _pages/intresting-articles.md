# Life Pro Tips

## Car Buying

- Know your credit score before going in. Preferable to visit a few credit unions to get a rate. Auto-loans already qualify for low interest.
- Don't buy the extended warranty. Don't buy anything the financial guy offers unless you plan on off-roading or putting hundreds of thousands of mils on the car quickly. 
- Always say that you are looking at a competitor's equivalent car. 
- Never buy the car on the same day you visit. Get the lowest quote they give you and then walk out. Come back the next day or next weekend. They will wait. 
- Don't be afraid to walk out since you have all the power in this relationship. 
- Your signature doesn't mean shit until you sign on the pink sheet in the financial guy's room. The sales guy will have you sign somewhere on his paper sometimes to initiate a "If I give you this quote and you sign here, you agree to buy". This is not law binding. Sign it anyways. 

## Stocks

- Don't buy into the momentum unless you want to swing trade. Wait until eveything cools off a bit. 
- People have the memory of a goldfish. Tragic events cause a sudden downtrend, but then people forget the atrocity and move on. The time to buy is when the stock is getting pummeled. Look at United Airlines May 2017 and Volkswagen 2016 for examples. 

# Documentaries

 - [Water and Power:  the California heist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6290202/)  Water == $$$

 - [Betting on Zero](https://www.netflix.com/title/80108609) - How Herbalife is a scam

## Diet

 - [Sour Grapes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5728684/) - counterfeit wine is apparently easy to fool even the best connoisseur.
