message: "The coronavirus pandemic has forced universities to switch to interval learning. picking up trash community service essay <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/</a> best custom essay service. \r\nBut what is happening nowadays can be called an special delivery of content to listeners in self-isolation . Many varsities  and the teachers themselves were not ready for the teach online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University educators with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never utilized remote video services to take part in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut  teachers are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not prepared for this, although education and its unique methods are the main function of varsities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work from home. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds absurd. Thus, the resourcefulness with which educators adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSome of the time it gets funny. Colleagues from regional academies said that some professors asked to write abstracts by hand and send them scans for according.Nowadays, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to modern digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with a single button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten conspectus and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education professor asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they make physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical excercises can be more originative, for example, you can make a selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the official domain, and teach them to play sports in self-isolation, while you can't go anywhere anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity teachers are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Some of them conduct lectures on Skype, someone -in Zoom, someone only sends tasks to WhatsApp. Some educators record lessons on a webcam and send them to their students. The quality of such materials is very low, and it is quite difficult  to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some teachers ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others ask  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and problems, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't get an educational experience on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>online thesis</a> \r\nOnline learning  does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Teachers have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
